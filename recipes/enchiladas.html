        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A timeless classic from south of the border, 
                enchiladas are a staple in the Mexican culture and
                are also super easy to make! These delicious rolled
                tortillas are filled up with your choice of meat, but for
                the purpose of this recipe, we will be using chicken. Who
                doesn't love chicken? The real punch and flavor comes from
                the salsa verde though. A delightful spicy flavor that
                leaves you with a good burn on your tongue but not so strong
                that you're left chugging milk. Here's a short list of the 
                ingredients you'll need!
            </p>
