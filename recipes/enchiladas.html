        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A timeless classic from south of the border, 
                enchiladas are a staple in the Mexican culture and
                are also super easy to make! These delicious rolled
                tortillas are filled up with your choice of meat, but for
                the purpose of this recipe, we will be using chicken. Who
                doesn't love chicken? The real punch and flavor comes from
                the salsa verde though. A delightful spicy flavor that
                leaves you with a good burn on your tongue but not so strong
                that you're left chugging milk. Here's a short list of the 
                ingredients you'll need!
            </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>rotisserie chicken</li>
                <li>corn tortillas</li>
                <li>your choice of cooking oil</li>
                <li>2lbs of tomatillos</li>
                <li>approximately 8 serrano peppers</li>
                <li>block of queso blanco</li>
                <li>crema or sour cream. Your choice!</li>
                <li>shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>OPTIONAL: avocado. We'll slice this at the end for a nice topping
                    on top of the lettuce, crema/sour cream, & cheese, but if you don't
                    like avocados, then you can simply ignore this item.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now that we got the ingredients out of the way, we can now start
            the process of making our delicious enchiladas!
            </p>
        <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>First thing first, we'll start by making the sauce. For this you'll simply
                    need a larg pot, the tomatillos, and the serrano peppers.
                </li>
                <li>We'll start by removing the husks from the tomatillos.</li>
                <li>Now we're going to "test" our serrano peppers. What I like to do
                    is cut the stem off from the serrano pepper, then cut a small
                    "slice" of it to lick & taste. If you feel your tongue burn,
                    that's a good one! Serranos tend to be hit or miss in my experience,
                    hence why I test them. You only want about 3 hot peppers, so once
                    you get 3 you like, you don't need to use the rest. You can use more
                    or less peppers depending on how hot you actually want the sauce to be.
                    Discard the small "test slices".
                </li>
                <li>Take a large sized pot and fill it up about two thirds with
                    water and bring to a boil. Once the water starts boiling,
                    throw in your tomatillos and serrano peppers. We'll let them sit in
                    there until they start browning. This process should take about 5-8
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>While we have the tomatillos and serrano peppers boiling, start shredding
                    pulling off all the chicken from the bones. We'll end up with shredded
                    chicken this way. Feel free to cook your own chicken breast or thighs
                    ahead of time as well, whatever you prefer. I simply use a rotisserie
                    chicken for the ease of it and one will be enough to feed a family of 4.
                </li>
            </ol>
