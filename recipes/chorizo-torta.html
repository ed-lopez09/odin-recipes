        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Everybody loves sandwiches. Tortas are basically the same thing, just served with some Mexican
                foods and toppings. They're <em>very</em> delicious and not hard to make! I'll be
                going over how to make a torta with some chorizo. From start to end, it shouldn't take more
                than a half hour and you don't need much to make them. Let's go over the ingredients you'll
                need to make these for yourself! This recipe will make enough for two tortas. You can adjust
                the measurements for however many you'd like to make. 
            </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Two bolillo rolls <em>or</em> telera bread. Your choice! Traditionally they're served on
                    telera bread but I regularly use bolillo rolls and they're just as good!
                </li>
                <li>6 oz of refried beans</li>
                <li>3 oz chorizo. I regularly use <a href="https://www.caciquefoods.com/products/pork-chorizo/"
                    target="_blank" rel="norefferer">this</a> chorizo but any kind should work.</li>
                <li>Two eggs</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Two hot dog sausages. Whatever kind you prefer!</li>
                <li>One cup chicken stock</li>
                <li>mayo</li>
                <li>OPTIONAL: one avocado</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that we got the ingredients out of the way, time to get started!</p>
        
            <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>We'll start simple. Cut the bolillo rolls/telera bread open. OPTIONAL: you can remove
                        the bread inside to make some room for the meat to sit in, but it's not required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next up we'll cook the sausages. Cut the sausages the long way twice. You should end
                        up with four long cuts of sausages.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a small pan on medium heat, place the four sausages in and be sure to flip them
                        to not burn them. They shouldn't take too long to cook through. They should all be
                        nice and brown when they're finished. Place on a plate once finished and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let's now cook the refried beans. In the same pan on medium heat as well, throw in the
                        refried beans and pour in the chicken stock as well. Mix for a few minutes. It's more
                        about warming them up more than cooking them. After a bit, leave on low heat but still
                        remember to stir every few minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Onto the chorizo. In a medium sized pan on medium heat, mix the chorizo until <em>
                        slightly</em>brown. Don't wanna cook it all the way through since we'll also cook the
                        eggs with the chorizo.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now with the chorizo slightly brown, crack your eggs into the pan and add a pinch of
                        salt on top. Now stir the two & they should both be fully cooked through at the same
                        time.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now time to put it all together! Put some mayo on your buns and on the bottom bun,
                        slather on some of the refried beans. Add in your chorizo, your sausages, and, if you
                        got an avocado, some avocado slices. Now you're ready to eat!
                    </li>
