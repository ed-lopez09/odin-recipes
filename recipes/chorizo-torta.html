        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Everybody loves sandwiches. Tortas are basically the same thing, just served with some Mexican
                foods and toppings. They're <em>very</em> delicious and not hard to make! I'll be
                going over how to make a torta with some chorizo. From start to end, it shouldn't take more
                than a half hour and you don't need much to make them. Let's go over the ingredients you'll
                need to make these for yourself! This recipe will make enough for two tortas. You can adjust
                the measurements for however many you'd like to make.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Two bolillo rolls OR telera bread. Your choice! Traditionally they're served on telera
                    bread but I regularly use bolillo rolls and they're just as good!
                </li>
                <li>6 oz of refried beans</li>
                <li>3 oz chorizo. I regularly use <a href="https://www.caciquefoods.com/products/pork-chorizo/"
                    target="_blank" rel="norefferer">this</a> chorizo but any kind should work.</li>
